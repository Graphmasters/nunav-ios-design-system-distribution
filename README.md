## Getting Started

NunavDesignSystem for iOS is distributed using the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). To add it to your project, follow the steps below.

### Package.swift

1. Add the following to your dependencies.

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/graphmasters/nunav-ios-design-system-distribution", from: "<VERSION>")
]
```

2. Add the dependency to your target.

```
.target(
    name: "Mytarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "NunavDesignSystem", package: "nunav-ios-design-system")
    ]
)
```

### Xcode

1. To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter its repository URL. You can also navigate to your target’s General pane, and in the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” section, click the + button, select Add Other, and choose Add Package Dependency.

2. Either add NunavDesignSystem GitHub distribution URL `https://github.com/graphmasters/nunav-ios-design-system-distribution` or search for `nunav-ios-design-system` package.
